public class Lab {
    /**
     * This is a method - which you've already seen, but will function as a basic example of what you'll be writing
     * in this lab.
     *
     * A method is a reusable block of code in Java. In other languages, this structure may also be referred to
     * as a 'function', but in Java, a method specifically is applied to an individual Object. We'll be getting
     * to Objects and OOP at a later point.
     *
     * What does 'public' do? 'public' is an access-modifier keyword that makes this method visible & usable in
     * classes outside this one, such as in test cases.
     *
     * What does 'void' do? 'void' is a return type. You may remember that other methods have had return types of
     * 'String' or 'int'. Most of the time, a method produces some sort of value as a result, which potentially
     * becomes usable in other parts of your program that have used this method. 'void' means that this method
     * is not intended to return anything, so no 'return' statement will be necessary.
     *
     * What does 'sample()' do? 'sample()' is the name of the method, and the 'method signature', such that Java
     * may identify this specific piece of code whenever sample() is used.
     */
    public void sample(){
        System.out.println("hello from the sample method");
    }
    /**
     * TODO: create a method within this class named 'lab()'.
     * You can provide it a public access modifier and a void return type.
     */
