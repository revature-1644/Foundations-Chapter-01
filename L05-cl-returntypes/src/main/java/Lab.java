    /**
     * This is a method - which you've already seen, but will function as a basic example of what you'll be writing
     * in this lab.
     *
     * A method is a reusable block of code in Java. In other languages, this structure may also be referred to
     * as a 'function', but in Java, a method specifically is applied to an individual Object. We'll be getting
     * to Objects and OOP at a later point.
     *
     * What does 'public' do? 'public' is an access-modifier keyword that makes this method visible & usable in
     * classes outside this one, such as in test cases.
     *
     * What does 'String' do? In this context, 'String' is a return type. Most of the time, a method produces some sort
     * of value as a result, which potentially becomes usable in other parts of your program that have used this method.
     * This method has a return type of 'String', so it MUST return a String, in this case, 'hello'.
